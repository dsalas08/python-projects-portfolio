# 🐍 Python Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my Python Projects Portfolio — a collection of hands-on projects I’ve built while learning Python through the **100 Days of Code** challenge. These projects showcase my progress, creativity, and growing comfort with writing clean, functional code.

## 🔧 Projects

### 🎨 Etch-a-Sketch Project  
**Repo:** [etch-a-sketch-project](https://github.com/dsalas08/etch-a-sketch-project)  
A drawing tool built using Python’s `turtle` module. The user controls a turtle with arrow keys to draw lines, rotate direction, and clear the screen — similar to the classic Etch-a-Sketch toy.

**Skills:** Python, Turtle module, keyboard input, event-driven programming

---

### ⚔️ Fighter Game (Turn-Based Battle)  
**Repo:** [fighter-game](https://github.com/dsalas08/fighter-game)  
A text-based battle game where players take turns attacking each other until one fighter is defeated. Features include randomized damage, risk-based attacks, and custom fighter creation.

**Skills:** Python, custom classes, loops, conditionals, randomization, game logic

---

### 🌀 Spirograph Art Generator  
**Repo:** [spirograph-art](https://github.com/dsalas08/spirograph-art)  
Generates vibrant spirograph patterns using the `turtle` module with dynamic colors and looped circular drawing. A fun visual way to practice loops and working with RGB color values.

**Skills:** Python, Turtle graphics, RGB color, loops, geometry

---

### 🐢 Turtle Race  
**Repo:** [turtle-race](https://github.com/dsalas08/turtle-race)  
A fun racing game built with Python’s `turtle` module. The player places a color bet, and six turtles race across the screen using randomized movements. Includes user input handling, loops, and colorful animation.

**⚙ Skills:** Turtle module, user input, loops, random numbers, modular functions, game state management

🐍 Snake Game
**Repo:** [dsalas08/snake-game](https://github.com/dsalas08/snake-game)
🎮 Description: A classic Snake Game built using Python's turtle module. The game uses object-oriented programming to manage movement, direction, and collision logic.

🧠 What I Learned:

How to structure code using classes and objects

Handling movement and collision using coordinates

Building game loops and timing with time.sleep()

Modular project structure and Git/GitHub workflow

💡 Reflection:

“This game taught me how to break logic into clean classes and how movement works using coordinates and directions. It was one of the most fun projects to build!”

🕹️ Pong Game 
**Repo:** [[pong-game](https://github.com/dsalas08/pong-game)
Description:
A 2-player Pong clone built using the turtle graphics module. Implements real-time paddle movement, ball physics, collision detection, scoring, and speed increase logic using object-oriented programming.

Skills Used:
Python, OOP, Classes, Game Loop, Turtle Graphics, Collision Detection, State Reset, Keyboard Control

Files & Structure:

main.py: Game loop and logic

paddle.py: Paddle class

ball.py: Ball class with bounce and speed logic

scoreboard.py: Scoreboard class

💬 Personal Reflection
“This project helped me understand how to split game logic into separate class files. I got more comfortable working with object-oriented design, especially how to create behaviors like bouncing and speed increase using methods. It was fun seeing it all come together in a real-time game I could actually play.”

## 🧠 Why This Exists

This portfolio is a snapshot of my growth as a developer. Each project helped me solidify different concepts — from basic loops and functions to OOP and user interaction.  
As I continue learning, I’ll refine and replace these with more advanced projects that demonstrate what I can really build.
