# 🐍 Python Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my Python Projects Portfolio — a collection of hands-on projects I’ve built while learning Python through the **100 Days of Code** challenge. These projects showcase my progress, creativity, and growing comfort with writing clean, functional code.

## 🔧 Projects

### 🎨 Etch-a-Sketch Project  
**Repo:** [etch-a-sketch-project](https://github.com/dsalas08/etch-a-sketch-project)  
A drawing tool built using Python’s `turtle` module. The user controls a turtle with arrow keys to draw lines, rotate direction, and clear the screen — similar to the classic Etch-a-Sketch toy.

**Skills:** Python, Turtle module, keyboard input, event-driven programming

### ⚔️ Fighter Game (Turn-Based Battle)  
**Repo:** [fighter-game](https://github.com/dsalas08/fighter-game)  
A text-based battle game where players take turns attacking each other until one fighter is defeated. Features include randomized damage, risk-based attacks, and custom fighter creation.

**Skills:** Python, custom classes, loops, conditionals, randomization, game logic

---

### 🌈 Spirograph Art Generator  
**Repo:** [spirograph-art](https://github.com/dsalas08/spirograph-art)  
Generates vibrant spirograph patterns using the `turtle` module with dynamic colors and looped circular drawing. A fun visual way to practice loops and working with RGB color values.

**Skills:** Python, Turtle graphics, RGB color, loops, geometry

## 🚀 Coming Soon
- Coffee Machine (Functional + OOP)
- Blackjack
- Quiz Game
- Raspberry Pi Projects (ML/AI)

## 🧠 Why This Exists

This portfolio is a snapshot of my growth as a developer. Each project helped me solidify different concepts — from basic loops and functions to OOP and user interaction.  
As I continue learning, I’ll refine and replace these with more advanced projects that demonstrate what I can really build.
